# # **Introduction**

# ## Conceptual Background

# In 2019, SARS-CoV-2 spilled into the human population, sparking a global pandemic from which we‚Äôve yet to emerge. Worryingly, SARS-CoV-2 is not the first zoonotic disease we‚Äôve encountered, nor is it predicted to be the last ([Jones et al. 2008](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06536); [Brulliard, 2020](https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2020/04/03/coronavirus-wildlife-environment/)). At the between-host level, we know that climate and land-use change can facilitate novel species interactions and increase contact rates between wild populations and humans, enabling zoonotic spillover events and disease emergence ([Daszak et al. 2000](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/287/5452/443.abstract); [Daszak et al. 2001](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.461.1781&rep=rep1&type=pdf); [Patz et al. 2004](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/ehp.6877); [Plowright et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro.2017.45?report=reader); [Plowright et al. 2020](https://ecoevorxiv.org/cru9w)). Less studied are the mechanisms that promote parasite diversity and allow parasites to circulate within hosts, creating kindling for the spillover events we observe among hosts. Separately, community ecologists have theorized that an intermediate level of disturbance may promote species coexistence by precluding the competitive advantages allowed by low levels of disturbance, and the extinction risks brought on by high levels of disturbance ([Connell 1978](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.199.4335.1302)).    
# 
# If we think about environmental variability as a sustained, or ‚Äúpress‚Äù, disturbance, there arise two separate but related ways to consider the effects of environmental variability on parasite diversity within hosts. First, we may consider rising environmental variability as an consequence of climate change. While much attention has been paid to the effects of rising temperatures on disease systems, we‚Äôve invested far less in exploring the effects of rising temperature variability, despite evidence of its outsized impacts on species outcomes ([Dobson and Carpenter 1992](http://www.ciesin.org/docs/001-364/001-364.html); [Lafferty 2009](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/08-0079.1); [Vasseur et al. 2014](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2013.2612)). In ectothermic hosts, increasingly erratic external conditions will affect the internal conditions of the host, thereby also affecting any parasites the host may harbour. Second, we may consider environmental variability as a physiological trait. Bats (order Chiroptera) have long been acknowledged as prolific reservoirs for disease and implicated in zoonotic spillover events ([Calisher et al. 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1539106/); [Brook and Dobson 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X14002480?casa_token=DbrKQUEEi00AAAAA:8RajgXtME2Uc3KP67wXNczRV70897WrfxnNAdAmtj9w4Mk3z8yjRLcazOLVNA6gsWW08sJ-0aVE); [Irving et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03128-0)). Bats are also somewhat unique in their ability to vary their internal temperature according to their activity level ([Fumagalli et al. 2021](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0211)). It has been theorized that these variations in internal temperatures may aid in bats‚Äô immune responses, allowing them to carry microparasites without suffering outsized morbidity (Fumagalli et al. 2021; [Luo et al. 2021](https://animalbiotelemetry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40317-021-00268-6)). Extending on that idea, we became interested in how variation in internal temperature may contribute to bats‚Äô propensity to support diverse communities of parasites.  
# 
# Here, we aim to investigate the impacts of environmental variability on the viability and maintenance of parasite diversity within hosts. We began by modifying [Antia et al.‚Äôs (1994)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/285686) model of within-host population dynamics to include a secondary parasite (see below). We wrote a demographically stochastic version of the model, an environmentally stochastic version of the model wherein each parasite‚Äôs growth rate was defined along a thermal performance curve, and a demographically and environmentally stochastic version of the model ([Melbourne and Hastings 2008](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06922)). We simulated each of these models forward in time, beginning simulations with the primary parasite in the system, and introducing the secondary parasite at different points along the timeseries. We simulated several permutations of the environmentally stochastic versions of the model, altering the frequency and magnitude of thermal disturbance within the system. All our simulations were performed in R.
# 
# ## For This Project:  
# 
# **Between and among the deterministic and stochastic simulations of the model, we will compare the ability of the secondary parasite to invade a system containing the primary parasite and the host‚Äôs immune system, and the number of time steps for which the primary and secondary parasites co-occurred.**  
# 
# To accomplish these goals, we will:  
# 1. Import our data from .rds files, to pandas data frames.  
#     a. Please note that all my data can be found [here](https://github.com/MadelineJC/CSB1021_FinalProject/tree/main/FinalProj_Data).
# 2. Explore the data.  
# 3. Wrangle the data.  
# 4. Analyse the data.  
# 5. Visualize the data.  

# # **Methods**

# ## Model Description
# 
# ### Antia et al.'s (1994) Model of Within-Host Population Dynamics:   
# Antia et al.‚Äôs (1994) model of within host population dynamics uses a system of ordinary differential equations to represent the interaction between an infecting parasite and its host‚Äôs immune system as analogous to the interaction between a prey item and its predator. The model assumes that the growth rate of the host‚Äôs immune system is proportional to parasite density at low parasite densities, and saturates at high parasite densities, allowing the host‚Äôs immune system to either extirpate or succumb to the infection (Eqns. 1-2) (Antia et al. 1994).  
# 
# \begin{align}
#     &\frac{dP}{dt} = rP - kPI \text{,  if P < D and P ‚ûù 0 if P > D}&\\
#     &\frac{dI}{dt} = œÅI\frac{P}{P + œï}&\\
# \end{align}  
# 
# Where: 

# In[1]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('html', '', '<style>\ntable {float:left}\n</style>')


# | Parameters | Values |
# | :--- | :--- |
# | P, Parasite abundance | NA |  
# | I, Host immune cell abundance | NA |
# | r, Intrinsic growth rate of parasite | 0.1 - 10.0 |  
# | k, Rate of destruction of parasite by host immune system | $10^{-3}$ |
# | œÅ, Maximum growth rate of the immune system | 1 |
# | ùúô, Parasite density at which growth rate of host immune system is half its maximum | $10^3$ |
# | D, Lethal within-host parasite density | $10^9$ |

# In the above model, $\frac{dP}{dt}$ and $\frac{dI}{dt}$ represent the changes in parasite and immune cell abundance over time. In (1), the first term denotes the growth of the parasite population, while the second term denotes its destruction by the host‚Äôs immune system. In (2), we can see that the host‚Äôs immune system will grow in response to the growth of the parasite population, until it hits a saturation point. To investigate the impacts of environmental variability on the viability and maintenance of parasite diversity within hosts, we discretized and modified Antia et al.‚Äôs (1994) model to include a secondary parasite, which could indirectly compete with the primary parasite through the host‚Äôs immune response (Eqns. 3-5).
# 
# ### Our Modified Version of Antia et al.'s (1994) Model:  
# 
# \begin{align}
#     &P_{i[t+1]} = (1 + r‚ãÖts - (1-e^{-k‚ãÖI_t‚ãÖts}))P_{i[t]}&\\
#     &P_{j[t+1]} = (1 + r‚ãÖts - (1-e^{-k‚ãÖI_t‚ãÖts}))P_{j[t]}&\\
#     &I_{[t+1]} = (1 + œÅ(\frac{P_i}{P_i + œï} + \frac{P_j}{P_j + œï})ts)I_{[t]}&\\
# \end{align}  
# 
# Where $P_i$ is our primary parasite, $P_j$ is our secondary parasite, and $I$ is the host's immune system.  
# 
# In our simulations, we decreased the range of possible values for  $r_i$ and $r_j$ from 0.1 - 10.0 to 0.1 - 2.0, and increased the rate at which parasites are destroyed by the host‚Äôs immune system by a factor of ten (from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$) to prevent the parasite from killing the host too quickly. Given that we‚Äôre interested in the mechanisms that affect parasite co-occurrence and diversity, we wanted to prevent transient infections where possible. To write the demographically stochastic version of this model, we wrote the model‚Äôs growth terms as Poisson processes, and the parasite population‚Äôs mortality term as a binomial process. To write the environmentally stochastic version of this model, we defined the growth rates of each parasite along thermal performance curves, which were developed in accordance with the Sharpe-Schoolfield model ([Schoolfield et al. 1981](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022519381902460)).  
# 
# ### Thermal Performace Curves
# 
# We wrote two sets of four thermal performance curves, representing two thermal environments, and four thermal arrangements per environment. One thermal environment had a lower average temperature, while the second had a higher average temperature, representing the thermal conditions within ectotherms and bats, respectively. Our four thermal arrangements represented how each parasite‚Äôs growth rate ($P_i$ and $P_j$, $r_i$ and $r_j$) would respond to the temperature of the system. We wrote our first arrangement such that $r_i$ and $r_j$ would respond identically to the temperature of the system, a second arrangement wherein $r_i$ and $r_j$ would peak on opposite sides of the average temperature of the system, a third arrangement wherein we moved the average temperature of the system to the left to give the first parasite, $P_i$, a thermal advantage, and a fourth arrangement wherein we shifted the average temperature of the system to the right to give $P_j$ a thermal advantage.  
# 
# ## Model Simulations
# 
# Within each of the two thermal environments, and each of the four thermal arrangements, we simulated each of our four models (deterministic, demographically stochastic, environmentally stochastic, and demographically and environmentally stochastic). Within the environmentally stochastic, and demographically and environmentally stochastic model simulations, we included two sets of permutations to alter the ways in which we randomly selected the temperature of the system. The first set of permutations varied the magnitude of thermal disturbance within the system and was applied to the low average temperature thermal environment runs to represent rising environmental variation in our climate, while the second set varied the frequency of thermal disturbance within the system and was applied to the high average temperature thermal environment to represent changes in the internal temperatures of bats. We began each simulation with the primary parasite in the system, and for each of our four model simulations, we permuted the time step at which the secondary parasite, $P_j$, was introduced into the system to determine how environmental variation might affect its ability to invade and co-occur. We ran each permutation of each of our stochastic models one thousand times.

# ## Importing and Exploring the Data  
# 
# After performing all our simulations in R, we saved our outputs first as data frames, then as .rds files. To import our data into Python, we'll using **rpy2**. According to the rpy2 [Github repository](https://rpy2.github.io/doc/v3.4.x/html/index.html), rpy2 is an interface to R running embedded in a Python process. rpy2 also includes functionality to deal with pandas DataFrames.  

# In[2]:


# Importing pandas so I can work with these data frames, and installing and importing rpy2, so I can import my data, as stored in .rds files.

readRDS = robjects.r['readRDS']

df = readRDS('FinalProj_Data/LowTemp_SD10/Det_Iden_LTLO.rds')
df

df2 = readRDS('FinalProj_Data/LowTemp_SD10/DemPV_I_LTLO.rds')
df2.head(n = 20) # Let's check out the first 20 columns; Does this look right? Yes!
df2.info()

df2.iloc[:,0] # Let's take a look at the first column!


# These data show co-occurrence times between our infecting parasites, $P_i$ and $P_j$. The columns denote the day on which the secondary parasite, $P_j$, was introduced to the system, while the rows denote the simulation number, out of 1000, within which the period of co-occurrence took place. For example, the value in the first column of the first row says that in our first simulation out of 1000 for which $P_i$ and $P_j$ were introduced at the same time (Intro_0), $P_i$ and $P_j$ co-occurred for 84 time steps, or 8.4 days. Our first test case, df, shows periods of co-occurrence in our deterministic model, while df2 shows periods of co-occurence over 1000 stochastic simulations of our demographically stochastic model. In df2, we may observe the average period of co-occurrence per introduction point by averaging each column. We may also see that when $P_j$ is introduced later, periods of co-occurrence tend to be shorter. Let's evaluate those claims with our test case, df2, before importing the rest of our data. 

# In[5]:


ColumnMeans = df2.mean(); ColumnMedians = df2.median()
ColumnMeans[0:11]; ColumnMedians[0:11]

Det = np.array(df[0:16]); DemMeans = np.array(ColumnMeans[0:16]); DemMedians = np.array(ColumnMedians[0:16])

plt.plot(Det, linewidth = 2, color = 'gold')

# As we can see on our plot, demographic stochasticity seems to have an insignificant impact on parasite co-occurrence within hosts. Now, let's import the rest of our data, and take a look at the impact of environmental variability!

# Let's get our paths in order... 
import os
os.chdir('/home/jovyan/2022-01-IntroPython')

# We want to know what our working directory is so we can write our pathnames correctly.  
# 
# Additionally, if we divorce our pathnames from our device, we can make our work easier to write out, and much easier to reproduce.  
# 
# In the cell below, I change working directories to import data so I don't have to write out a full pathname like 20 times. There are better ways to do this, and generally, it's not a good idea to mess around with your working directory, but this was the easiest way to accomplish the task after messing around with [**pyprojroot**](https://github.com/chendaniely/pyprojroot) to no avail. **pyprojroot** is supposed to work similarly to R's **here** package, which enables easy file referencing in project-oriented workflows to remove problematic path dependencies.

# Now, let's write a couple loops, so we can interate through each of our lists of stochastic data, and average periods of co-occurrence over each group of 1000 stochastic simulations!  
# 
# As a reminder, each list, ClimateChange_List and Bats_List, contain outputs of stochastic model simulations. Each item in each list contains one set of simulations, contained in a pandas data frame and comprised of 50 columns and 1000 rows. Each column is a day on which the second parasite is introduced to the system, and each row is a stochastic simulation. So, the first column contains the periods of co-occurrence resulting from 1000 stochastic simulations, within which the second parasite was introduced at the same time as the first parasite (t = 0, "Intro_0").  
# 
# What we want to do, is average each column, to get an average period of co-occurrence per introduction day.  
# 
# In the for loops below, we iterate over the length of each list, taking the means of each column, in each data frame, in each list item. We store the resulting mean periods of co-occurrence in initially empty pandas data frames.  

# In[11]:


ClimateChange_Means = pd.DataFrame()
for i in range(len(ClimateChange_List)):
    ClimateChange_Means[i] = ClimateChange_List[i].mean()

Bats_Means = pd.DataFrame()
for i in range(len(Bats_List)):
    Bats_Means[i] = Bats_List[i].mean()

# Re-naming our columns so we know what we're looking at! Now we can see our averaged periods of co-occurrence by model abd thermal arrangement (column) and introduction time of second parasite (row)

# ### Interpretation: 
# Great! This shows us that in the absence of stochasticity, $P_i$ and $P_j$ can co-occur for a maximum of 92 time steps, or, 9.2 days. This will act as our baseline, against which we'll compare our stochastic simulations. We can also see that our thermal arrangement wherein the secondary parasite, $P_j$, has the thermal advantage over the primary parasite, $P_i$, seems to produce the longest periods of co-occurrence, while our thermal arrangements wherein $P_i$ and $P_j$ respond identically to the temperature of the system, and wherein $P_i$ has a thermal advantge over $P_j$ seem to produce the shortest periods of co-occurrence. These outcomes make sense given that $P_i$ has the inherent advantage of being introduced to the system first, which allows its population to grow before the introduction of $P_j$, making the invasion of $P_j$ more difficult, and the viability and longevity of co-occurrence less probable and shorter.

# 
# ### Interpretation:  
# These plots shows us that where demographic stochasticity seems to have little influence on the viability and maintenace of co-occurrence between $P_i$ and $P_j$, envionmental stochasticity seems to promote both the viability and maintenance of co-occurrence. We see that in our simulations that include environmental stochasticity, the likelihood of co-occurrence at later introduction points is higher and periods of co-occurrence tend to be longer than in deterministic or demographically stochastic simulations.  
# 
# We also see that when the magnitude of thermal disturbance is larger, this effect is exacerbated, implying that as our climate continues to change and becomes more variable as a consequence, we may see increased co-occurrence between parasite within hosts, increasing within-host parasite diversity. Let's take a closer look at this effect in the next two plots.    
# 
# Finally, we see, as shown in our previous two plots, that our thermal arrangement wherein the secondary parasite, $P_j$, has the thermal advantage over the primary parasite, $P_i$, produces the longest periods of co-occurrence.

# ### Interpretation:  
# These plots show us, as before, that environmental stochasticity seems to promote the viability and longevity of co-occurrence. In particular, we can see that as we increase the frequency of thermal disturbance from once every two days to five times/day, we see increases in the viability and longevity of co-occurrence between $P_i$ and $P_j$, suggesting that environmental variation may be the key to bats' ability to harbour such large communnities of parasites. Additionally, we see, as before, that our thermal arrangement wherein the secondary parasite, $P_j$, has the thermal advantage over the primary parasite, $P_i$, produces the longest periods of co-occurrence.

# # **Discussion**  
# While we are beginning to understand the mechanisms that drive spillover events and disease emergence at the between-host level, we have yet to thoroughly investigate the mechanisms that promote parasite diversity and allow parasites to circulate within hosts, creating kindling for the spillover events we observe at the between-host level (Daszak et al. 2000; Daszak et al. 2001; Patz et al. 2004; Plowright et al. 2017; Plowright et al. 2020). Given the predictions of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, the fact that our climate is becoming more variable, and the additional fact that internal temperature variability is physiological trait unique to a noted reservoir for disease, we set out to investigate the relationship between environmental variability and parasite diversity within-hosts (Vasseur et al. 2014; Calisher et al. 2006; Brook and Dobson 2015; Irving et al. 2021).  
# 
# In summary, we found that on average, environmental variability can increase the ability of a secondary parasite to invade a single-parasite system, and can promote longer periods of co-occurrence between the primary and secondary parasites within the host. In our low average temperature environment, meant to represent the thermal conditions within ectotherms subject to rising environmental variability, we found that larger changes in thermal conditions increased the viability and longevity of parasite co-occurrence, suggesting that as our climate continues to change, we should pay special attention to ectotherms‚Äô propensities to support large communities of microparasites. Moving forward, we hope to develop a more detailed characterization of the relationship between the magnitude of thermal change and parasite co-occurrence. In our high average temperature environment, meant to represent the thermal conditions within bats, whose internal temperatures vary rapidly throughout the day, we found that frequent environmental variations increased the viability and longevity of parasite co-occurrence to a greater degree than did less frequent disturbances. These results suggest that, while it has been theorized that variations in internal temperatures may aid in bats‚Äô immune responses, these variations may also allow bats to support uniquely large communities of parasites (Fumagalli et al. 2021; Luo et al. 2021). Further, these results, combined with the frequency with which bats are implicated in zoonotic spillover events suggest that the effects of environmental variability on parasite diversity may scale to the between-host level to have effects on disease emergence. While the impacts of climate change on parasite diversity, and of parasite diversity on global health level remain disputed, these results should give us pause and reason to investigate further ([Carlson et al. 2013](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.342.6162.1041-a); [Carlson et al. 2017](https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.1602422); [Cizauskas et al. 2017](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.160535)).
